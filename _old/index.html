        <h1>....but I'm Le Tired</h1>
            <h2>a site where I try stuff out - take 8</h2>
      </div>
   </div>


        <p>This is my first website. As I learn more stuff, I'll update and change things here. It's a type of on-going rough draft.</p>
        <section class="first_story">
            <p>As I'm diving into HTML &amp; CSS basics, I'm realizing that it's (thankfully) fairly logical and straight-forward. A lot of the complications come about just trying to keep track of everything that you're trying to do. I'm guessing that there is a better was to annotate a website, or the design so that you can keep track of the different aspects of each website - like a website map of sorts for developers. This has to go beyond the comments that you put intfo the code, because once that code get longer and longer, even reading through all the comments becomes a herculean task.<br/>
            Another complication comes from all the subtle design tweaks that make a website go from average to professional: distinct color pallets, shading, transparency, translucency, font families, which ones work best together, the spacing between lines, their location relative to other text on the site, how to maintain a (relatively) consistent experience between different experiences (desktop/tablet/phone) and so many other things.... Not the least of which is the interplay between the elements of a page nd how changing the attributes of one will affect the rest.<br/>

            </p>
        </section>
        <p>
            Anyway, this is an attempt to see how different CSS styles with line spacing affect how sections of text are viewed once rendered in the browser.
